# Vulcan Next

Vulcan Next helps you build GraphQL-based applications with Next.js.

## What's in the box?

Vulcan Next provides:

- A production-grade Next.js + Apollo GraphQL boilerplate. It includes development tooling such as Cypress, Jest, Storybook, MDX... and many others.
- A GraphQL API endpoint set up with Apollo Server, so you can start coding back-end features immediately.
- Schema-based helpers and hooks to quickly generate and consume your own GraphQL API.

## A word about Vulcan.js aka Vulcan Meteor

You can't teach an old dog new tricks! Vulcan Next is the successor of "Vulcan.js", the Meteor framework from [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/). It inherits years of experience, with a modernized architecture that replaces Meteor by Next.js.

## Install and run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcan-next.git
yarn
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
You can then access the live docs on [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

### Setup your own git repository

#### Initialization

Rename "origin" to "upstream", so you can use your own git repository as the main origin and VN official repo as "upstream".

```sh
git remote rename origin upstream
# Then do what you need to create your own origin remote
# git remote add origin <your-own-git-repository-url>
```

#### Update

**Beware:** Vulcan Next is a boilerplate, the possibility to update automatically is not guaranteed. You may
have to apply the updates by hand, comparing Vulcan Next latest version to your own code.

```sh
# Get the latest version of Vulcan Next locally
git fetch upstream
# Merge to your own code (favouring your own code as a default in case of conflict)
git merge upstream/master -X ours
```

### Roll your own Mongo database

As a default, Vulcan Next will connect to a sample read-only database owned by LBKE.
To create your own application, you'll want to use your own databse.

#### 1. Run a Mongo server using Docker

It will run Mongo in your current terminal, or create and run a Mongo image if it's the first time your run the command.

**Note:** you should always start your database *before* you run the application.

```sh
yarn run start:mongo
```

[**See Docker installation instruction for Ubuntu here**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) if you don't have Docker yet.

#### 2. Configure your application to use your local database

In `.env.development` or `.env.development.local` use this URI for Mongo:

```sh
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/vulcan-next-app"
```

You can then stop the server and start it again.

We advise to use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) to visualize your database content.
